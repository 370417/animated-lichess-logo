      to make it work outside the browser. I thought it might be nice to explain
      what I’m doing as I go along, hence this blog post.

    <p>
      I've been interpolating inner and outer path length linearly, but I don't
      think I should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      From every point on inner/outer path, draw normal, find intersection of
      normal and animation path. If animation path isn't long enough, extend it
      with tangent lines. Use the distances between these intersection points to
      decide how fast to move along inner/outer path. But what if normals cross
      each other, making the distance negative? I guess that means the curvature
      is unrealistically large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derive lengths along inner/outer path from <i>reciprocals</i> of lengths
      between intersection points of normals and animation path. Though using
      reciprocals will break if there is division by 0. So instead we need to
      interpolate by adjusting x values, not y values?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nvm, we need to store outer/inner path length by animation path length.
      Since animation path length is not in regular increments, we can't use a
      list to represent this number to number map. Can use a sorted map instead?
      And we need to scale the keys of the map to make the values fit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, in theory the normal is the wrong thing to use. What we actually
      need is the closest point to the inner/outer curve. The normal is a good
      approximation of closest distance when the curves are close to parallel,
      but not if the curves are significantly skewed.
    </p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>
      For regularly sampled points (by t) on inner/outer path, find the closest
      point to it on the animation path (animation path extended by tangent rays
      in case of overhang). Take these closest points, put them in a list, and
      calculate the cumulative lengths along them. The total length can be
      bigger or smaller than the actual length of the animation path along the
      relevant segment because of over/underhang (ie when at the start of the
      segment the leading edge is not perpendicular to the animation path). We
      don't care because we normalize these lengths so that the total length is
      1. This data lets us take a current length ratio along the animation path,
      binary search in the data to find the two closest values in the data, and
      lerp to estimate the true index we are looking for. This index can then be
      translated to a t value on the inner/outer path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculating tangents at endpoints: if closest control point is unusable
      (produces dy/dx of 0/0), use the other control point. It that is also
      unusable, use the other endpoint. If that is unusable, all four of your
      points are the exact same, so any line counts as tangent.
